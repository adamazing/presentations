# Ok, so what now? Can anyone just write one of these Cop things?
  
  Well we've already got some Custom Cops in the `flick_lint` gem, so we can have a look at how those take the 
  Abstract Syntax Tree representation and turn it into the judgmental, passive-aggressive messages in your terminal!

  [flick_lint](/Users/adam/Documents/Projects/flick_lint/lib/flick_lint/cops/env_access.rb)
                  

# How do we know that the Cops we write are doing the right thing?

  Great question! Because we're honest and law-abiding developers, and because no-one is above the law, we 
  need to make sure our Custom Cops are tested! And that THEY follow the law!
